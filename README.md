# Streamlining-Employee-Data


# Motivation Behind this project

- You just got hired as the first and only data practitioner at a small business experiencing exponential growth. The company needs more structured processes, guidelines, and standards. Your first mission is to structure the human resources data. The data is currently scattered across teams and files and comes in various formats: Excel files, CSVs, JSON files, SQL databasesâ€¦

- The Head of People Operations wants to have a general view gathering all available information about a specific employee. Your job is to gather it all in a file that will serve as the reference moving forward. You will merge all of this data in a pandas DataFrame before exporting to CSV.

- Data management at your company is not the best, but you need to start somewhere. You decide to tackle the most straightforward tasks first, and to begin by loading the company office addresses. They are currently saved into a CSV file, office_addresses.csv, which the Office Manager sent over to you. Additionally, an HR manager you remember interviewing with gave you access to the Excel file, employee_information.xlsx, where the employee addresses are saved. You need to load these datasets in two separate DataFrames.

- I have applied data cleaning and manipulation techinques that finally gives an insights from the data. The final CSV file generated from this exercise will be sturctured inforamtion.
